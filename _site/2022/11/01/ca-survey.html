<h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>
<p>The general architecture of a conversational agent is given in <em>Figure 1</em>. Traditional techniques follow this architectural division closely and implement specialized modules for each component of the agent. However it is becoming increasingly common to combine one or more components in favour of more end-to-end conversational agents. This is especially true when using large deep learning models as they are able to implement more than one component, often with better results due to information sharing between the tasks of individual components.</p>

<h1 id="state-of-the-art-techniques">State-of-the-art techniques</h1>
<p>Here’s a survey of state-of-the-art techniques for building entire conversational agents or one or more individual modules shown in <em>Figure 1</em>. All papers are linked in the table and also at the end. A few other interesting papers, papers on human-in-the-loop techniques and studies on building conversational agents are also linked at the end.</p>

<h4>State-of-the-art techniques for each module</h4>
<p>Here is a grouping of papers based on which architectural component their techniques apply to. The key points of each paper are summarized.</p>

<h1 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h1>
<p>Frameworks are an important starting point for the development of a conversational agent as they can provide a standard data format, pretrained models, dialog system pipelines, etc. I ultimately chose Rasa to implement my conversational agent but there are many frameworks out there suited for a wide variety of tasks. Here’s a survey of the most popular platforms and frameworks available.</p>

<h1 id="datasets">Datasets</h1>
<p>Datasets are necessary for training custom models to use for language understanding/dialog management or for training end-to-end conversational agents. Good quality datasets are very important for dialog applications since the agent needs to produce good quality text to hold a satisfying conversation. Here is a survey of the most popular datasets available for training conversational agents.</p>
